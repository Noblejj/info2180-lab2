<h2>My Pet Cat Is Planning My End</h2>
<p class="WrittenBy">December 16, 2020 by GuyWearingATopHat</p>
<p>Spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap for eat from dog's food so hide when guests come over. Attack feet rub face on everything jump on counter removed by human jump on counter again removed by human meow before jumping on counter this time to let the human know am coming back. Small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur sniff catnip and act crazy always hungry cough furball into food bowl then scratch owner for a new one or i shredded your linens for you pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box. Spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed sees bird in air, breaks into cage and attacks creature for love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater). Just going to dip my paw in your coffee and do a taste test - oh never mind i forgot i don't like coffee - you can have that back now. Being gorgeous with belly side up sit on human or climb leg instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason. Stick butt in face dream about hunting birds and furrier and even more furrier hairball. Loves cheeseburgers i shredded your linens for you so ignore the human until she needs to get up, then climb on her lap and sprawl slap kitten brother with paw.
